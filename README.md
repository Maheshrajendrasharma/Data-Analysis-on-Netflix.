* ## Discovered that 45-50% of content are related to Adults and Remaining 55-50% for Teens and Kids (COMBINED) are less than Adult hence teen content must be added as they are the good candidate (more users) for our viewership.
* ## Recommended to keep the audience engaged, it is recommended to keep the movie length upto 160 minutes and upto 3 seasons for a TV Show ie (Maximum available length) of the content.
* ## Recommended that TV-Shows must be released during vacation in India to employ viewers attention. Hence, they can add TV-Shows based on the Popular actors in movies category.
